### About Me

Hello, I'm Zeeshaan Mohammed, a passionate machine learning engineer and aspiring data scientist. I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at California State University, Los Angeles, where I'm immersing myself in the exciting world of AI and ML.

With a strong foundation in Python, Java, and SQL, I love to explore the endless possibilities that data-driven technologies offer. My journey in the field of machine learning has led me to develop scalable predictive models and delve into complex problem-solving. During my previous internships, I had the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge projects, such as a human lurking detection system and a state-of-the-art facial recognition system.

I'm an advocate for open-source collaboration and believe in the power of sharing knowledge.

When I'm not coding or diving into datasets, you can find me exploring new AI-driven applications, working on personal projects, or crafting innovative solutions to real-world challenges. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals, collaborate on exciting projects, and continue learning and growing in the ever-evolving field of data science and machine learning.

Let's code, learn, and innovate together! Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories and connect with me. 👨‍💻📊🚀
